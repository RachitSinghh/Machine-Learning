    "               the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. \n",
    "               Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. \n",
    "               We have not grabbed their land, their culture, \n",

    "               we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us.\n",

    "               It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top 5 nations of the world\n",
    "               in terms of GDP. We have a 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling.\n",
    "               Our achievements are being globally recognised today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to\n",

    "               strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand. \n",
